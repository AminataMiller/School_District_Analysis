# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
	Maria, chief data scientist for the school district is responsible for analyzing the student data for the school district. But the school board wants the math and reading scores not considered into the analysis for Thomas High School ninth graders.

### Purpose
	In this analysis we will be working with student data by removing all the ninth-grade students math and reading scores for THS and replace them with NaN and redoing the data frames. 

## Results

* District Summary is affected by the removal of the THS ninth graders data with the math, reading and overall passing percentages drop slightly by less than a half percent.
Below is screenshot for before and after the removal of the THS ninth grader scores:
